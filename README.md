# wavefcn-prep-qiskit
A short guide to preparing wavefunctions (particularly the Gaussian) in Qiskit.

This requires Qiskit v.18.0 or later, and is an implementation of the Kitaev-Webb algorithm for generating a discrete periodic Gaussian. It is important to read the pdf that is included in this branch in order to fully understand the problem and the motivations behind the circuit construction.
